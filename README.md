# Identification of Distorted RF Components via Deep Multi-Task Learning

% This code generates a dataset for the paper called "Identification of Distorted RF Components via Deep Multi-Task Learning"
% In the code, several radio frequency impairments and models the distorted hardware components based on some threshold.
% The number of samples and thresholds can be changed based on the user requirements. 
% This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. A detailed explanation of the dataset will be publicly available after the acceptance of the paper.
